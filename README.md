## Data Set 1: the Chemotherapy data

This dataset is a subset of data reported by Bekker Bekker et al (2000), which represents the survival times (in years) of a group of 46 patients who received chemotherapy treatment alone.

## Data Set 2: Depressive data

This dataset consists of the scores of the "general rating of affective symptoms for preschoolers" (GRASP) scale of children, which measures children's behavioral and emotional problems.

### special instruction:
Some the the data contains another number in parentheses. For example, 19(16), means that there are 16 observations of the number 19.

## Data Set 3: Covid-Mexico data

This dataset recorded the mortality rates of the patients infected by the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico and was studied by Zhou et. al 2023. This dataset consists of 106 observations from March 31, 2020, to July 20, 2020.
